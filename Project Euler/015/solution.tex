The number of ways to get to a site is the number of ways to get to
the site at its left plus that to the site above it.  Therefore if we
write down the number of ways respectively on each site, the grid
forms a Pascal triangle (rotated by $45^{\circ}$).  And therefore the
number of ways to get to the bottom right corner of a $20 \times 20$
grid is
\startformula
  {40 \choose 20}.
